# Runs PostgREST's upstream pytest-based `test/io` suite against an EXTERNAL
# database (the multigateway, or a direct-postgres baseline) instead of the
# temporary DB the upstream nix `withPg` harness provisions.
#
# Unlike the hspec suite (Dockerfile.spec), the io suite does NOT need the
# Haskell test code — it drives a real `postgrest` binary over HTTP and manages
# config reloads, roles and an admin server itself. So this image needs only
# (a) the pinned `postgrest` executable and (b) a Python + pytest environment,
# not a cabal build. We therefore use PostgREST's OFFICIAL prebuilt release
# binary for the pinned tag (checksum-pinned per repo supply-chain rules) on a
# slim Python base — far faster and more reproducible than compiling.
#
# The suite spawns `postgrest` subprocesses with a filtered libpq env
# (PGDATABASE/PGHOST/PGUSER only — see test/io/conftest.py::baseenv), so to
# repoint them at the gateway over TCP with a password we install a tiny
# `postgrest` shim that sources extra libpq vars (PGPORT/PGPASSWORD/PGSSLMODE)
# the harness passes in at `docker run` time. The only upstream source change
# is the default startup timeout below; test assertions stay unchanged.
#
# Built and run as linux/amd64 (the harness passes `--platform linux/amd64` to
# both `docker build` and `docker run`; emulated on Apple Silicon, native on CI):
# PostgREST ships a fully STATIC x86-64 release binary that runs on any base with
# no shared-lib deps, whereas the aarch64 build is dynamically linked and would
# need extra runtime libs. This matches how the sibling hspec image already runs
# here. (No `--platform` on FROM — hadolint DL3029; the build flag drives it.)
FROM python:3.11-slim-bookworm

# One-shot build/test image: it runs the io suite to completion against an
# external database, then exits. Not a long-running service.
