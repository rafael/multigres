// even with the feature flag on and even when the call spells out
// failover=true explicitly. Admitting it would freeze a decision made under
// a live, operator-toggleable flag into a stored definition that keeps
// re-executing every time postgres invokes it (SELECT/REFRESH for a view,
// INSERT for a DEFAULT, INSERT/UPDATE for a CHECK constraint or an index),
// with no further text for the planner to ever re-examine, so turning the
// flag off would not stop it (see
// isImmediatelyExecutedForFailoverAdmission).
//
// Each case spells out failover => true on purpose: without it the call
// would be rejected anyway for omitting failover, and the test would pass
// without ever exercising the allowlist it exists to cover. This is also
// deliberately not an exhaustive list of every PostgreSQL construct that
// can store an expression (rules, RLS policies, and SQL-language
// function/trigger bodies are the same shape of risk but aren't exercised
// here) — the point of the allowlist is that none of them need to be
// enumerated individually to be covered.
