# GitHub Workflow

If you are new to Git and GitHub, we recommend to read this page. Otherwise, you may skip it.

Our GitHub workflow is a so called triangular workflow:

The Multigres code is [hosted on GitHub](https://github.com/multigres/multigres).
This repository is called *upstream*.
You develop and commit your changes in a clone of our upstream repository (shown as *local* in the image above).
Then you push your changes to your forked repository (*origin*) and send us a pull request.
Eventually, we will merge your pull request back into the *upstream* repository.

## Remotes

Since you should have cloned the repository from your fork, the `origin` remote
should look like this:

```
$ git remote -v
origin  git@github.com:<yourname>/multigres.git (fetch)
origin  git@github.com:<yourname>/multigres.git (push)
```

To help you keep your fork in sync with the main repo, add an `upstream` remote:

```
$ git remote add upstream git@github.com:multigres/multigres.git
$ git remote -v
origin  git@github.com:<yourname>/multigres.git (fetch)
origin  git@github.com:<yourname>/multigres.git (push)
upstream        git@github.com:multigres/multigres.git (fetch)
upstream        git@github.com:multigres/multigres.git (push)
```

Now to sync your local `main` branch, do this:

```
$ git checkout main
(main) $ git pull upstream main
```

Note: In the example output above we prefixed the prompt with `(main)` to
stress the fact that the command must be run from the branch `main`.

You can omit the `upstream main` from the `git pull` command when you let your
`main` branch always track the main `multigres/multigres` repository. To achieve
this, run this command once:

```
(main) $ git branch --set-upstream-to=upstream/main
```

Now the following command syncs your local `main` branch as well:

```
(main) $ git pull
```

## Topic Branches

Before you start working on changes, create a topic branch:

```
$ git checkout main
(main) $ git pull
(main) $ git checkout -b new-feature
(new-feature) $ # You are now in the new-feature branch.
```

As you work in a package, you can run just
the unit tests for that package by running `go test` from within that package.

When you're ready to test the whole system, run the full test suite with `make
test` from the root of the Git tree.
If you haven't installed all dependencies for `make test`, you can rely on the CI test results as well.
These results will be present on your pull request.

## Committing your work

When running `git commit` use the `-s` option to add a Signed-off-by line.
This is needed for [the Developer Certificate of Origin](https://github.com/apps/dco).

## Sending Pull Requests

Push your branch to the repository (and set it to track with `-u`):

```
(new-feature) $ git push -u origin new-feature
```

You can omit `origin` and `-u new-feature` parameters from the `git push`
command with the following two Git configuration changes:

```
$ git config remote.pushdefault origin
$ git config push.default current
```

The first setting saves you from typing `origin` every time. And with the second
setting, Git assumes that the remote branch on the GitHub side will have the
same name as your local branch.

After this change, you can run `git push` without arguments:

```
(new-feature) $ git push
```

Then go to the [repository page](https://github.com/multigres/multigres) and it
should prompt you to create a Pull Request from a branch you recently pushed.
You can also [choose a branch manually](https://github.com/multigres/multigres/compare).

## Addressing Changes

If you need to make changes in response to the reviewer's comments, just make
another commit on your branch and then push it again:

```
$ git checkout new-feature
(new-feature) $ git commit
(new-feature) $ git push
```

That is because a pull request always mirrors all commits from your topic branch which are not in the `main` branch.

Once your pull request is merged:

*  close the GitHub issue (if it wasn't automatically closed)
*  delete your local topic branch (`git branch -d new-feature`)
