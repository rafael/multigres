# Query Plan Cache in Multigres

## Overview

This document describes the design of the query plan cache in Multigres. The
plan cache stores the result of query planning (routing decisions, shard
targeting, etc.) so that repeated queries with different literal values can
skip planning and reuse a previously computed plan.

The cache lives inside multigateway and is shared across all client connections
on a single gateway instance.

## Background: Why Cache Plans?

For every query that arrives at multigateway, the executor must:

1. Parse the SQL text into an AST
2. Analyze the AST to pick a route (which shard, which primitive)
3. Execute the chosen primitive

Steps 1 and 2 are collectively called _planning_. Planning is deterministic for
a given query shape — `SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = 1` and
`SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = 99` produce the same routing decision. Paying
the planning cost on every execution is wasteful when the same query pattern
arrives thousands of times per second.

> **Note**: When shard-aware routing is introduced, literal values in shard key
> columns will affect routing, and the normalization/caching strategy will need
> to account for this.

The plan cache avoids replanning by mapping a normalized query string to a
previously computed `Plan` object.

## Query Normalization

### The Problem

Literal values in a query change its text without changing its plan. To build
a shared cache key across executions with different literals, we strip literals
out and replace them with positional parameter markers.

### The `Normalize` Function

`go/common/parser/ast/normalizer.go` provides `Normalize(stmt)`:

- Walks the AST and replaces every `A_Const` leaf (a literal value) with a
  `$1`, `$2`, ... parameter reference in order of appearance
- Returns the normalized SQL string (used as the cache key) and the extracted
  bind values (used at execution time)

**Example**:

```sql
Input:  SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = 42 AND region = 'us-east'
Output: SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = $1 AND region = $2
Bind:   [42, 'us-east']
```

### Skipped Cases

Normalization is intentionally skipped for nodes where the literal value
affects planning, not just execution:

| Node type          | Reason                                                                                                                                        |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `NULL` constants   | Semantic keyword; `WHERE x = NULL` and `WHERE x = $1` can mean different things                                                               |
| `VariableSetStmt`  | `SET work_mem = '64MB'` — value is part of the command                                                                                        |
| `VariableShowStmt` | `SHOW <variable>` — name is the operand                                                                                                       |
| `DefElem`          | Used inside DDL option lists where literal values affect the DDL itself                                                                       |
| `SELECT INTO`      | Temp-table variants use a different primitive (`TempTableRoute`); non-temp variants are DDL-like, so caching is skipped for all `SELECT INTO` |

Queries that cannot be normalized fall through to the normal (uncached) path.

### Cross-Protocol Unification

PostgreSQL clients speak two protocols:

- **Simple protocol**: Query arrives as a complete SQL string with literal
  values embedded (`SELECT * FROM t WHERE id = 42`)
- **Extended protocol**: Query arrives pre-parameterized (`SELECT * FROM t WHERE id = $1`)
  with bind values sent separately in the Bind message

Both paths produce the cache key via `SqlString()` on the AST, which yields a
canonical form independent of the original keyword casing or whitespace. This
means a plan built from a simple-protocol execution can be reused for an
extended-protocol execution of the same query shape and vice versa.

### SQL Reconstruction

For simple-protocol execution, the route's `NormalizedAST` holds the normalized
AST, and `ReconstructSQL(normalizedAST, bindVars)` substitutes the current
literal values back in before sending SQL to the backend.

For ordinary extended-protocol execution, the route forwards the prepared
statement and the portal's separate Bind values. When the route SQL differs
only by AST normalization, `Route.PortalStreamExecute` preserves the stored
query text. This keeps Parse, Describe, and Execute on the same exact-text
pooler cache key, even though the gateway routing plan uses a normalized key.
An in-transaction Parse has already prepared that named backend statement.

A semantic rewrite still uses the route's rewritten SQL and can need a distinct
backend preparation. The gateway routing cache and the pooler's per-connection
prepared-statement cache have different keys and lifetimes. See
[prepared statements](prepared_statements_design.md#query-identity-and-execution-time-rewrites)
for the rewrite refresh rules.

## Cache Implementation

### Eviction: W-TinyLFU

The cache is backed by a W-TinyLFU (Window Tiny Least Frequently Used)
implementation vendored in `go/common/cache/theine/`.

W-TinyLFU maintains two regions:

- **Window cache** (1% of capacity): Admits all new entries; acts as a
  probationary zone
- **Main cache** (99% of capacity): Only accepts entries that pass a frequency
  filter (the TinyLFU sketch)

The frequency filter uses a Count-Min Sketch and a Bloom filter doorkeeper:

- The **Bloom filter** quickly rejects one-time queries from entering the main
  cache at all, protecting against cache pollution by rare queries
- The **Count-Min Sketch** tracks approximate access frequency and decides
  whether a candidate entry is more valuable than the entry it would evict

This eviction policy is well-suited to database query workloads, where a small
hot set of queries dominates traffic and one-off queries (e.g., ad-hoc
analytical queries) should not evict popular plans.

### Concurrency

The store is partitioned into independent shards. Each shard has its own lock,
so concurrent reads and writes across different shards proceed without
contention. A shard is selected by hashing the cache key.

A `singleflight` group prevents thundering-herd problems: if many goroutines
miss the cache simultaneously for the same key, only one plans the query; the
rest wait for the result.

### Memory Accounting

The cache is capacity-bounded by memory. Each `Plan` reports its memory cost
via `CachedSize(bool) int64`, which accounts for:

- The `Plan` struct overhead
- The length of the normalized SQL string
- An estimate of the normalized AST tree (~10× the query string length)

The cache enforces the configured memory limit and evicts entries when the
limit is reached.

## Invalidation

Schema changes (DDL) can invalidate all cached plans. Iterating through the
entire cache to remove entries would be O(n) and would require holding locks.

Instead, the cache uses **epoch-based invalidation**:

- Each cache entry is tagged with the epoch at the time of insertion
- A global epoch counter is stored atomically alongside the cache
- `Invalidate()` increments the epoch counter in O(1)
- `Get()` compares the entry's epoch against the current epoch; a stale entry
  is treated as a cache miss and the caller replans

This means DDL statements (ALTER TABLE, CREATE INDEX, DROP TABLE, etc.) call
`Invalidate()`, and all subsequent `Get()` calls see a clean slate without
any locking or iteration.

## Configuration

| Flag                  | Env var                | Default          | Description                                                        |
| --------------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `--plan-cache-memory` | `MT_PLAN_CACHE_MEMORY` | `4194304` (4 MB) | Maximum memory for the plan cache in bytes. Set to `0` to disable. |

The plan cache is initialized in `go/services/multigateway/init.go` and passed
to the executor at startup. Setting `planCacheMemory` to `0` disables caching
entirely; all queries fall through to the uncached planning path.

## Executor Integration

### Cacheable Statements

Only DML statements that go through `planDefault()` are cached:

- `SELECT` (excluding `SELECT INTO` temporary tables)
- `INSERT`
- `UPDATE`
- `DELETE`

Statements that bypass the cache:

- DDL (`CREATE`, `ALTER`, `DROP`, `TRUNCATE`, …)
- Transaction control (`BEGIN`, `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`)
- Session commands (`SET`, `SHOW`)
- `LISTEN` / `NOTIFY`
- Any statement where normalization is skipped

### Simple Protocol Path (`StreamExecute`)

```text
Client sends: SELECT * FROM orders WHERE id = 7
                          │
                     Parse → AST
                          │
                     Normalize
                          │
                  cache key: "SELECT * FROM orders WHERE id = $1"
                  bind vals: [7]
                          │
              ┌───── Cache lookup ─────┐
              │ HIT                   │ MISS
              │                       │
         Reuse plan              Plan normalized SQL
              │                       │
              └──────────┬────────────┘
                         │
              ReconstructSQL(normalizedAST, [7])
                         │
              Execute → backend SQL: SELECT * FROM orders WHERE id = 7
```

### Extended Protocol Path (`PortalStreamExecute`)

Extended protocol queries already arrive with `$1`, `$2`, … placeholders and
bind values in separate Bind messages. The normalized SQL is effectively the
parameterized query text itself. The executor looks up the cache using that
text, and on a miss plans it and caches the result. On subsequent executions
(or on simple-protocol executions of the same shape), the cached plan is
reused.

### ExecuteResult

The `ExecuteResult` struct returned by both paths includes a `CacheHit bool`
field, allowing callers and tests to observe whether a given execution used the
plan cache.

## Metrics

Two OpenTelemetry counters are emitted:

| Metric                | Description                                    |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `mg.plancache.hits`   | Number of executions that reused a cached plan |
| `mg.plancache.misses` | Number of executions that required planning    |

In addition, `plancache.Evictions()` returns the total number of entries
evicted by the W-TinyLFU policy, useful for tuning the memory limit.

## Design Trade-offs

### Shared Cache vs. Per-Connection Cache

The plan cache is shared across all client connections on a gateway instance.
This maximizes cache utility — a plan computed for one connection is
immediately available to all others. The downside is that the cache must be
thread-safe, which is handled by shard-level locking inside Theine.

### Cache Key Structure

The cache key is `database + "\x00" + normalizedSQL`. The database prefix
prevents plans from one database being reused for another (different databases
may have different schemas and, eventually, different sharding configurations).
The null byte separator is unambiguous since neither database names nor SQL
strings can contain it.

For cross-protocol cache sharing, both the simple protocol and extended protocol
paths produce the normalized SQL via `SqlString()` on the AST. This ensures
the same canonical form regardless of keyword casing or whitespace differences
in the original client query text.

Using string keys rather than AST structural hashes is deliberate — strings are
easier to reason about, trivially comparable, and avoid the complexity of
defining equality over AST nodes.

### Rough AST Size Estimate in `CachedSize`

The `CachedSize` function estimates AST memory as approximately 10× the query
string length. This is a deliberate approximation — computing an exact size
would require walking the entire AST tree on every cache insertion, adding
latency on the miss path. The approximation keeps memory accounting fast while
remaining directionally correct for capacity management.

### No Per-Table Invalidation

Currently, `Invalidate()` clears the entire cache. A more targeted approach
would only invalidate plans that reference the affected table. This was
intentionally left as a future optimization: DDL is rare, and the cache warms
up quickly after an invalidation event.

## Future Work

### Schema Tracking for Cache Invalidation

`planCache.Invalidate()` exists and works correctly, but nothing calls it yet.
Wiring up DDL detection to trigger invalidation is **deliberately deferred**:
the planner does not currently consume schema information. Routing decisions
are derived from the query text and the tablegroup topology, not from table
definitions. A plan produced before a DDL statement is byte-identical to one
produced after, so a stale cache entry still yields the correct plan — there
is nothing to invalidate.

This calculus changes when the planner starts to rely on schema metadata.
Likely triggers:

- Resolving table names against `search_path` (see the note in the cache-key
  trade-off above)
- Column-level validation or pruning during planning
- Shard-aware routing, where the shard key and its type affect the primitive
  that is selected

At that point a plan built against an old schema could become incorrect (for
example, routing to a dropped column, or missing the fact that a table was
moved between tablegroups), and we will need a signal from multipooler to
invalidate the cache on DDL.

#### Reference Implementation

[PR #824](https://github.com/multigres/multigres/pull/824) prototypes the
full pipeline and is preserved as the starting point for when schema-driven
invalidation is actually required:

- A `schemaTracker` in multipooler that detects DDL via a PostgreSQL event
  trigger (`ddl_command_end` → `pg_notify`), with catalog polling as a
  fallback for changes missed during disconnects
- A monotonically increasing `schema_version` counter broadcast in the
  multipooler health stream
- Per-connection version tracking in the multigateway load balancer that
  fires a callback when the version advances — the hook that would call
  `planCache.Invalidate()`

The PR was closed rather than merged because carrying the plumbing without
a consumer adds surface area (an event trigger installed in every primary,
an extra health-stream field, a new component in the pooler lifecycle) for
no behavioral benefit today. Reopen or rebuild from it when the planner
grows a real dependency on schema.

### Generated `CachedSize`

The current `Plan.CachedSize()` is a hand-written estimate that uses a
rough multiplier for the normalized AST tree size. This approximation is
acceptable for capacity management but can drift if the plan structure changes.
The right fix is to auto-generate `CachedSize` using a code generator (similar
to Vitess's `cachedsize` tool) that walks all primitive types and AST node
types and emits an exact byte accounting. This would make memory limits
precise and remove the need to update `CachedSize` manually as the plan
structure evolves.
