# Multigres Developer Documentation

This documentation is **for developers working on Multigres**. If you're looking
to use Multigres for your applications, please refer to the
[official documentation](https://multigres.com/) instead.

## Structure

- **[Architecture](./architecture.md)**
- **[How to build](./building.md)**
- **[Working with us](./teamwork.md)**
- **[Github workflow](./workflow.md)**
- **[Contributing](./contributing.md)**

## Design Documents

Browse the design and reference docs by area:

- **[Query serving](./query_serving/)** — connection pooling, prepared
  statements, transactions, session settings, plan caching, query
  cancellation, failover buffering, replica reads, listen/notify, etc.
- **[Prepared-statement design](./query_serving/prepared_statements_design.md)**
  — backend preparation, query identity, and DDL recovery. See
  [prepared-statement testing](./query_serving/testing_strategy.md#prepared-statement-preparation-and-ddl)
  for regression coverage and validation commands.
- **[High availability](./ha/)** — consensus, failover, and the state model,
  plus the HA decision log.
- **[General](./general/)** — cross-cutting topics (e.g. serving state
  management, [logging conventions](./general/logging.md)).
- **[pgctld init](./pgctld-init.md)** — data directory initialization: the init
  flags, execution order, superuser password resolution, init SQL, and init
  secrets (role passwords and database settings).

## Alpha Deployment Notes

- **[Integration with Kubernetes](./kubernetes/integration.md)** — how the
  Multipooler and pgctld present to Kubernetes, and what the readiness and
  liveness probes mean.
- **[Getting started on EKS](./kubernetes/eks.md)**

## Release Documentation

- **[Release artifacts and verification](../RELEASE.md)**

## PostgreSQL Compatibility

multigres runs the official PostgreSQL regression test suite to track compatibility.

- **Results:** See the [latest workflow run][pgregress-ci] for the detailed
  compatibility report in the Job Summary.
- **PostgreSQL compatibility artifacts:** Each run uploads
  `postgres-compatibility-results`, which includes the compatibility report and
  PostgreSQL regression diffs when results are produced.
